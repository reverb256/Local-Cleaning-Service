# Deployment Status - GitHub Pages Ready

## Current Status: Deployment Ready ✅

### GitHub Pages Configuration Complete
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` configured for automatic deployment
- **Static Build**: `vite.config.static.ts` optimized for GitHub Pages hosting
- **Public Assets**: All required files in `client/public/` including `.nojekyll`, `404.html`
- **Deployment Script**: `./deploy.sh` ready for one-command deployment

### Key Features Preserved in Static Build
- Full visual design with dynamic gradient backgrounds
- Working quote calculator (client-side calculations)
- Contact forms with graceful fallbacks to phone/email
- PWA functionality and offline support
- WCAG AAA accessibility compliance
- All animations and interactive elements

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Single command deployment
./deploy.sh
```

This will:
1. Build static version with `VITE_STATIC_BUILD=true`
2. Commit changes to repository
3. Push to GitHub triggering automatic deployment
4. Site live in 2-5 minutes

### Repository Requirements
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Deployment automatically triggered on push to main branch

### Post-Deployment Site Features

3. Enable SSL and performance optimizations
4. Enhanced CDN and security features
