# FAQ

### How do we maintain worksite quality?

Our inspector routinely monitors the cleaning performance of our staff with unannounced visits to your building.

Routine feedback on performance corrects issues and reinforces good behavior and habits.

Account managers schedule walk-throughs to ensure work is being done to your expectations.

### What steps are taken to safeguard your building and business security?

All staff pass criminal background checks as a hiring procedure.

Our cleaning staff carry 1 set of keys which are coded so your building cannot be identified.

A duplicate set of keys is kept in our office in a locked cabinet under video surveillance. Our office is also protected by an alarm and medical keys are used so no unauthorized copies can be made.

We require 2 sets of keys, alarm code, alarm company contact and clearance numbers.
