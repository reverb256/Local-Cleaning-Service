[Winnipeg's commercial office cleaning](https://officecleaningwinnipeg.com/) industry often offers rushed "in & out" office cleaning programs to companies looking for the cheapest office cleaning service.

This comes at a price! The faster the service, the lower the quality.

Business owners like YOU have built your companies on trust-based relationships where the exchange of high-quality services and/or products are expected. No doubt YOU also would like a trust-based relationship with your office cleaning service provider.

You want an office cleaning service company that can be reliable, stay at your place of business for a set period of time and guarantee the quality of their work.

### Workplace Janitorial’s office cleaning services are designed to address your concerns about time on site and overall quality.

**Our offer features:**

1. A comprehensive on-boarding process or “trial period” designed to identify your specific needs for office cleaning services. This process is designed to provide your company the office cleaning services required and nothing more. Hence keeping the fees for your specific office cleaning program down.
2. Once your trial is completed, we design an office cleaning work-plan that specifically fits your needs and budget.
3. Our office cleaning service programs are designed to keep your designated office cleaner(s) at your place of business for designated amount of time.
4. The time we recommend for an office cleaner on-site is always 30 minutes more than required. This is regarded as valuable time as it allows your dedicated office cleaner an opportunity to slow down and clean more thoroughly. Many clients have very nice furniture and office buildings and appreciate that their office cleaners are not in a rush while vacuuming and dusting etc.
5. We guarantee your satisfaction. Our processes for ensuring compliance are thorough and provide the evidence you need to feel satisfied you are receiving good value.
